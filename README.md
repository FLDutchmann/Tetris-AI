# Tetris AI

This repository contains an exerpt from a school project I did in the last year of secondary school. 
Its purpose was to showcase three different generations of a genetic algorithm playing tetris. 

The makefile requires the [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) development library to be installed.
